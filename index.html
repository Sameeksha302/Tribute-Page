                        <p>Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962  - 1 February 2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut
                            and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to go to space.
                            Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster
                            when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 
                            2003.</p>

                  <li>Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, Haryana.She completed her schooling from Tagore 
                      Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School,Karnal. </li> 
                      <li>Kalpana was born youngest of his parents four children, she had two elder sisters named Deepa and Sunita and an elder brother named Sanjay.
                          From the very beginning, the children were encouraged to work hard and to gather knowledge.She went to local flying clubs and watched planes with
                      her father.</li><li>After earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab 
                      Engineering College,India ,she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in 
                      Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984.Chawla went on to earn a second 
                      Masters in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University
                      of Colorado Boulder.</li>

                <ul class ="py-4">
                    <li>In 1988, Kalpana Chawla began her career at NASA's Ames Research Center. There, she started working on power-lift computational fluid dynamics, concentrating on the concept of vertical and/or short take-off and landing. Once the project was complete, she began working on mapping of flow solvers to parallel computers.</li>
                    <li>In 1993, she was made Vice President of Overset Methods Inc. and moved to Los Altos, California, with the responsibility of developing efficient techniques to perform aerodynamic optimization and implementing the same. There, she formed a team of researchers and began working on simulation of moving multiple body problems.</li>
                    <li>In December 1994, she was selected to join NASA Astronaut Corps, a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Its job is to select, train, and provide astronauts not only for U.S., but also for international space missions and is based at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston.</li>
                    <li>In March 1995, she joined Johnson Space Center as an Astronaut Candidate in the 15th Group of Astronauts. There, she underwent rigorous training for one year, at the end of which she was assigned to the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches to work as crew representative.</li>
                    <li>As crew representative, she was assigned to work on the development of Robotic Situational Awareness Displays. Besides, she was also assigned to test space shuttle control software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class ="py-4">
                    <li>In November 1996, Chawla was assigned to Space Shuttle Columbia flight, STS-87 as Mission Specialist 1 and the primary Robotic Arm Operator. It was launched on November 19, 1997 from Launch Complex 39B of the Kennedy Space Center.</li>
                    <li>During her first mission, Chawla spent around 15 days (376 hours, 34 minutes) in space, making 252 orbits around the earth, traveling a total distance of 6.5 million miles. The mission returned to the earth on December 5, 1997.</li>
                    <li>Among other experiments, STS-87 mainly focused on how the weightless in the space affects physical processes. They also tested EVA tools and procedures and observed the outer atmospheric layers of the sun.</li>
                    <li>Chawla was especially responsible for deploying a Spartan satellite, which developed a snag, requiring two members of the crew, Winston Scott and Takao Doi, to take a spacewalk and manually capture it. Later it was found that there was an error in the software interfaces, which absolved her of negligence.</li>

                <ul class ="py-4">
                    <li>In 2000, Kalpana Chawla was selected as a Mission Specialist for STS-107, the final flight of Space Shuttle Columbia. It was a scientific mission and included a small laboratory, christened as 'space hab'. The laboratory was seven meters in length, five meters in width and four meters in height.</li>
                    <li>Initially it was planned that the mission would take off on January 11, 2001; but was delayed 18 times due to technical problems and scheduling conflicts. Eventually it was launched on January 16, 2003 from Kennedy Space Center's LC-39-A. But the launching was not without any hitch.</li>
                    <li>81.7 seconds after the launch, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing of the orbiter, damaging it considerably. At that time, STS-107 was at an altitude of about 65,600 feet, traveling at a speed of 1,650 miles per hour.</li>
                    <li>The space shuttle remained in the space for 15 days, 22 hours, 20 minutes, 32 seconds. During this period, the mission crew worked twenty-four hours a day in two alternating shifts, performing nearly 80 experiments, focusing not only on space science, but also on health and safety of the astronauts.</li>
                    <li>After a successful trip in the space, STS-107 re-entered the earth's atmosphere on February 1, 2003. But the crew never reached home because 16 minutes before the scheduled landing at Kennedy Space Center, the space craft disintegrated over Texas, killing each of them.</li>

The couple did not have any children. In 1991, she became an American citizen.</li>
